# Engaged OmniFocus Plugin

Inspired by the navigation concept in [Kourosh Dini's book Creating Flow with Omnifocus](https://www.kouroshdini.com/course-books/). It is sometimes more effective to have a navigation task that shows up on the Forecast perspective instead of a long list of tasks contained in a project.

Creates a new Task inside an "Engaged" Project with a link back to the selected Project that triggers the automation.
